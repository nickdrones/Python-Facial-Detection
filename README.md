### Simple Python + OpenCV Facial Detection

This code uses the cascade file (provided by OpenCV) to perform facial tracking efficiently and quickly. It uses the OpenCV library and currently creates a box around the face in real time.

#### Required

- opencv-python

`$ pip install opencv-python`

- numpy

`$ pip install numpy`

#### Future Plans
I plan to use this code as the base for a library that would allow for single-line facial detection in other programs that would simply return the X and Y coordinates for the face
